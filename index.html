            <p>We are the Food Scramblers, our mission is to reduce the unmeasurable daily wastage of perfectly good food that instead of being thrown into the trash, could be being thrown into the mouths of other people.</p>
            <p>Our vision is a world in which food isn't just thrown away after someone (like rich great-grandson-of-a-plantation-owner with a skin of light proportions and wealth produced and inherited from the abuse of the vile institution of slavery, but then has the nerve to go into Twitter and start talking about how "weLl AcsHUali, BlACk pIpoL Ar thE rEAl racIsTs, cause they dont like getting arrested or shot, and like, they talk about reparations when slavery ended like forever ago" even though slavery ended less than a century ago, and for fucks sake, just because slavery ended that doesnt mean that fuckers like you just accepted racial equality. What about black codes? What about Jim Crow laws? What about racial profiling? What about them? What about dept peonage and convict leasing? WHAT ABOUT DEBT PEONAGE AND CONVICT LEASING. WHAT ABOUT DEBT PEONAGE AND CONVICT. FUCKING. LEASING?! FUCK YOU, THE WORLD WOULD BE AND HAVE BEEN A BETTER FUCKING PLACE IF YOU AND YOUR FUCKING WHITE SOUTHERNER ANCESTORS HAD NEVER EXISTED SO STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM IN THIS) feels "full" or doesn't like it and just tosses it to the garbage</p>
